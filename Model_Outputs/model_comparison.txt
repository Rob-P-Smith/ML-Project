Model Analysis & Impact of 50% Reduction in Key Factors
Based on the statistics, here's how the models would predict GMSL changes with 50% reductions in key contributors:

Random Forest (98.53% accuracy, MAE 5.77mm) identifies barrels equivalent (20.06%), population (19.82%), and oil production (19.31%) as the most significant factors. A 50% reduction in these three factors could theoretically reduce GMSL predictions by ~29.6% (summing half of their combined feature importance of 59.19%).

Linear Regression (98.18% accuracy, MAE 6.41mm) shows average temperature has the strongest coefficient (-8.0473), suggesting temperature control could have the largest impact. However, the model's higher MSE (75.92 vs RF's 61.43) indicates less reliable predictions.

Logistic Regression (82.76% accuracy) confirms population (1.0327) and annual loss (0.7511) as significant trend drivers, but is better suited for classifying above/below trend predictions rather than precise GMSL values.

The Random Forest model provides the most robust predictions for precise GMSL values, while focusing mitigation efforts on reducing oil/fuel consumption and population growth could have the most significant impact on future sea levels.
