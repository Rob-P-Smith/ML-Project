# ML-Project
Class project to learn ML and apply ML to a global warming vs sea level rise model. Current models lack resilience to missing parameters.
TODO:  
Find more data!  
Clean/process new data into the model input file  
train the model  
test the model with different parameters to determine what likely outcomes will be  
identify the strongest correlations between input parameters and expected GMSL rise by 2100  
identify the strongest correlations between input parameters and expected temperature rise by 2100  
determine what input values will slow the sea level rise and taper the temperature rise (aka what do we need to achieve in what areas to get a stable planet)
